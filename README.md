## Reflections

To ensure my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I focus on building strong unit tests, validating input carefully, and following good security practices during development. I also review my code for edge cases that could cause errors or vulnerabilities.

When interpreting user needs, I rely on requirements gathering, user stories, and direct feedback to guide my design choices. I try to think from the userâ€™s point of view and prioritize features that make the experience intuitive and effective.

My approach to designing software is to start with clear planning. I break down the program into smaller components, design each part with single responsibility in mind, and build modular, scalable code that is easier to maintain and expand later.
